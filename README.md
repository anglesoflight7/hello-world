# hello-world
this repository is for me to learn and practicde coding.
My nameis mikey Snyder and I am extremly interested in computers, cars and gaming! I am extremly fascinated by pretty much allsubjects though. However i realize the need to buckle down andtruly learn specific things like programming and machine learning so i will be able to actually correctly implement the ideas i have from my learning. I have a wife who is etremly supportive and helpful which makes life much easier as well as fun.
